# Web Server

RPi is perfectly capable of hosting a small web site. This is also a prerequisite for [NextCloud](https://sites.google.com/site/alensit/platforms/raspberry-pi/server/nextcloud) and possibly other network host functions.

## Apache2

Install with

`sudo apt-get install apache2 -y`

Restart Apache: `sudo systemctl restart apache2`.
